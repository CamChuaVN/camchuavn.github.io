    <p>Why are you here? Are you lost? Are you questioning your existence? I mean, you have
      been searching for something that either have gone or just... doesn't exists yet. If you are
      here to find good ol' stuffs, then I guess it's gone. Forever. Maybe it won't ever come back
      anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything have its own lifetime. Not just you. Not just me. But we have been living to
      search for our own definition of life. We have been searching for memories. We have been
      searching for love. And we have been searching for our future. And we will keep searching
      to find out why. And we will keep searching until we are gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why I'm here", you asked yourself. There's nothing else you can do next. You keep
      searching inside the dark. You keep searching to find the light. And you are here, stare
      at the void...
